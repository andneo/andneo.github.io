A classic example would be: How do I get somewhere as (fast, cheap, environmentally friendly, …) as possible? Nature optimises too, a big part of what I did in my PhD was finding out how systems of particles optimise their potential energy. Needless to say, optimisation is an important process, and quite a bit of effort has been dedicated to developing algorithms that do it well. As we will see, optimisation algorithms form a key component of neural networks. The first section of these notes introduce some of the theory underpinning these optimisation algorithms, and how to implement them in Python.\nSome Background Maths Before getting stuck into optimisation algorithms, we should first introduce some of the maths needed to understand the algorithms and the notation we’ll use. First, and maybe most important, is the objective function. This function should provide some quantitative description of our process of interest (think of it as a measure of success).\nFor instance, in our above example of getting to some destination the objective function could be some mathematical expression which involves the time or cost of the journey. We denote the objective function as $f(\\textbf{x})$, where $\\textbf{x}$ is an $n$-dimensional vector of parameters. So in our journey example, $\\textbf{x}$ would be a 2d vector where the first parameter ($x_{0}$) would be time and the second parameter ($x_{1}$) would be cost. We could therefore write $\\textbf{x}=(x_{0},x_{1})^{T}$ (where the $^{T}$ means we are dealing with a row vector). Our objective function will then involve some combination of these parameters, for instance this could be: $$ f(\\textbf{x}) = x_{0}^2 + x_{1}^2 $$ I have plotted this function for $x_{0},x_{1}\\in[-10,10]$ below, and we can see (from the 3D representation on the left) it has a bowl-like shape (actually we would call this a paraboloid). We can also see that when $\\textbf{x}=(0,0)^{T}$, $f(x_{0},x_{1})=0$. We would say that this point corresponds to the minimum of the function $f(\\textbf{x})$. On the right I’ve shown a 2D contour plot of the same function, as well as the gradient. The gradient for this function is given by: \\begin{align} \\textbf{g}(\\textbf{x}) \\equiv \\nabla f(x_{0},x_{1}) \u0026amp;= \\Big(\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{0}}, \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{1}}\\Big)^{T} = \\Big(2x_{0}, 2x_{1}\\Big)^{T} \\end{align} The gradient defines a vector field, which points in the direction of maximum rate of increase for its corresponding function. This is an important property of the gradient which we are going to exploit. If none of this is familiar to you I would suggest going through a course like this one.\nOptimisation Problems We are interested in solving the general optimisation problem: $$ \\min_{\\textbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}}f(\\textbf{x}) $$ In other words, we want to find a set of coordinates which correspond to a minimum of the function $f(\\textbf{x})$. We are going to do this using an optimisation algorithm. There are different algorithms to choose from, but they all follow the same general process: iteratively update an initial guess for $\\textbf{x}$ until some termination condition is satisified.\nThe difference between different algorithms comes from how we move from $\\textbf{x}_{i}$, at iteration $i$ of our algorithm, to $\\textbf{x}_{i+1}$. We want to write some Python code that can optimise arbitrary functions using different optimisation algorithms. The first step is to define a Class:\n1class Optimise: 2 def __init__(self, X, function, gradient, err, method): 3 # Initialise input parameters for the optimisation algorithms 4 self.X = X # Coordinates of the function. 5 self.f = function # Function to be optimised. 6 self.g = gradient # Gradient of the function. 7 self.err = err # Threshold convergence value 8 self.method = method # ID of the line search method This Class has three key attributes:\nX: The coordinates which we are to optimise, $\\textbf{x}$. f: The objective function to be optimised, $f(\\textbf{x})$. g: The gradient of the objective function, $\\textbf{g}(\\textbf{x})$. There are two more parameters, err and method. We use the err parameter to define our termination condition, and the method variable to decide which method to use. For now we’ll just include the steepest descent algorithm.\n9# Initialise parameters describing the convergence of the optimisation algorithms 10 self.nsteps = 0 11 self.path = [] 12 self.steps = [] 13# Perform local optimisation. 14 if(method==1): 15 self.steepest_descent() 16# Extract the coordinates of the local minimum and the path taken to it. 17 self.minimum = self.path[-1] 18 self.path = numpy.array(self.path).T We have also created some new variables which we are going to use to monitor the path the algorithms take to the minimum, and their convergence properties. Also, on line 18 we use a function from NumPy which we’ll be using a lot more of later on when we actually start to …","date":1687993200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687993200,"objectID":"8a9a1864a4e8e97c403d24578be326e2","permalink":"https://andneo.github.io/notes/deep_learning/01_numerical_optimisation/01_gradient_based_optimisation/","publishdate":"2023-06-29T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/notes/deep_learning/01_numerical_optimisation/01_gradient_based_optimisation/","section":"notes","summary":"A brief overview on the theory underpinning gradient-based optimisation algorithms (steepest descent and conjugate gradients) and their implemention.","tags":null,"title":"Gradient-Based Optimisation","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1687993200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687993200,"objectID":"787e94b7d0ca0eed208494a56f555294","permalink":"https://andneo.github.io/notes/deep_learning/01_numerical_optimisation/02_quasi_newton_methods/","publishdate":"2023-06-29T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/notes/deep_learning/01_numerical_optimisation/02_quasi_newton_methods/","section":"notes","summary":"An overview of the BFGS and L-BFGS minimisation algorithms along with inexact line search algorithms, and their implementation.","tags":null,"title":"Quasi-Newton Methods","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\n\n\n\n\n","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557010800,"objectID":"a234d703d844abfd034b40509dbaaf2e","permalink":"https://andneo.github.io/notes/deep_learning/01_numerical_optimisation/03_autograd_forward/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/notes/deep_learning/01_numerical_optimisation/03_autograd_forward/","section":"notes","summary":"An introduction to forward-mode automatic differention and its implementation using operator overload in Python.","tags":null,"title":"Forward-Mode Automatic Differentiation","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\n\n\n\n\n","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557010800,"objectID":"8ada3b1ab344a14818c558607346068c","permalink":"https://andneo.github.io/notes/deep_learning/01_numerical_optimisation/04_autograd_backward/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/notes/deep_learning/01_numerical_optimisation/04_autograd_backward/","section":"notes","summary":"We implement reverse-mode automatic differention in Python and introduce some graph theory tools.","tags":null,"title":"Reverse-Mode Automatic Differentiation","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\n\n\n\n\n","date":1683241200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1683241200,"objectID":"776772a6065f559a75fed272a7659254","permalink":"https://andneo.github.io/notes/deep_learning/01_numerical_optimisation/05_linear_regression/","publishdate":"2023-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/notes/deep_learning/01_numerical_optimisation/05_linear_regression/","section":"notes","summary":"We take all the components we built above to do linear regression (which is a little bit of overkill for this problem).","tags":null,"title":"Putting it all Together: Linear Regression","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.

While the double-gyroid morphology as a bicontinuous structure is not uncommon in self-assembled soft materials, direct self-assembly of single-network gyroids has proven elusive. Here, an enantiomorphic pair of single-gyroid crystals comprising colloidal spheres is presented, and two distinct routes are demonstrated for programmed self-assembly of each single colloidal gyroid enantiomorph from rationally designed patchy spheres. The designer colloidal patchy spheres, which closely hew to their synthetic feasibility, are chiral, having either two staggered rectangular patches at opposite poles or four circular patches arranged in a well-defined geometry. The single colloidal gyroid, as well as its inverse structure, is shown to support a wide complete photonic bandgap in addition to exhibiting rich chiroptical properties, making them attractive chiral photonic crystals. The versatility of this single colloidal gyroid, the bottom-up routes devised here in silico, and the robustness of the design space for the chiral colloidal patchy spheres together make a strong case for single colloidal gyroids to supersede colloidal diamond, as a target for programmed self-assembly, in the quest for photonic crystals operating at optical frequencies.","tags":[],"title":"Programmed Self-Assembly of Single Colloidal Gyroids for Chiral Photonic Crystals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andreas Neophytou","Dwaipayan Chakrabarti","Francesco Sciortino"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1660176000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660176000,"objectID":"c472fa3d9c85b72350cdee5329e4ea63","permalink":"https://andneo.github.io/publication/22_08_11_nat_phys/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/22_08_11_nat_phys/","section":"publication","summary":"Computer simulations revealing the topological nature of the liquid–liquid phase transition in colloidal water.","tags":[],"title":"Topological nature of the liquid--liquid phase transition in tetrahedral liquids","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andreas Neophytou","Dwaipayan Chakrabarti"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"05a6be3b7d294a1ceae1b81370c385cf","permalink":"https://andneo.github.io/publication/22_01_01_frontiers/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/22_01_01_frontiers/","section":"publication","summary":"Programmed self-assembly of colloidal particles into certain colloidal open crystals has drawn much attention as a potential low-cost scalable fabrication route to photonic crystals with a complete photonic band gap in the visible spectrum.

Here we present a case study investigating the self-assembly of tetrastack crystals from designer triblock patchy particles with equal-size patches on the poles. We demonstrate how two distinct choices for the interactions between the patches alter the underlying energy landscapes to promote crystallisation. We show that if the equal-size patches on the poles are distinguished, either by a hierarchy of interactions or specificity of interactions to rule out the interactions between distinct patches, crystallisation is favoured by the suppression of the formation of five- and seven-member rings, which otherwise result in amorphous structures.

While spherical particles decorated with four patches in a tetrahedral arrangement—tetrahedral patchy particles—should be an ideal building block for this endeavor, their self-assembly into colloidal diamond has proved elusive. The kinetics of self-assembly pose a major challenge, with competition from an amorphous glassy phase, as well as clathrate crystals, leaving a narrow widow of patch widths where tetrahedral patchy particles can self-assemble into diamond crystals. Here we demonstrate that a two-component system of tetrahedral patchy particles, where bonding is allowed only between particles of different types to select even-member rings, undergoes crystallization into diamond crystals over a significantly wider range of patch widths conducive for experimental fabrication. We show that the crystallization in the two-component system is both thermodynamically and kinetically enhanced, as compared to the one-component system. Although our bottom-up route does not lead to the selection of the cubic polytype exclusively, we find that the cubicity of the self-assembled crystals increases with increasing patch width. Our designer system not only promises a scalable bottom-up route for colloidal diamond but also offers fundamental insight into crystallization into open lattices.","tags":[],"title":"Facile self-assembly of colloidal diamond from tetrahedral patchy particles via ring selection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ming Xiao","Anna B.

To investigate how the short-range correlations affect the trade-off between saturation and angle-independence, we vary the structure factor and use a Monte Carlo model of multiple scattering to investigate the resulting optical properties. We use structure factors derived from analytical models and calculated from simulations of disordered sphere packings. We show that the trade-off is controlled by the first peak of the structure factor. It is possible to break the trade-off by tuning the width of this peak and controlling the sample thickness. Practically, this result shows that the protocol used to pack particles into a photonic glass is important to the optical properties.","tags":[],"title":"Investigating the trade-off between color saturation and angle-independence in photonic glasses","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andreas Neophytou","Vinothan N.

However, their realization via self-assembly pathways is a long-standing challenge. This challenge is rooted in three fundamental problems: the design of building blocks that assemble into diamond-like structures, the sensitivity of the PBG to stacking faults, and ensuring that the PBG opens at an experimentally attainable refractive index. Here we address these problems simultaneously using a multipronged computational approach. We use reverse engineering to establish the design principles for the rod-connected diamond structure (RCD), the so-called “champion” photonic crystal. We devise two distinct self-assembly routes for designer triblock patchy colloidal rods, both proceeding via tetrahedral clusters to yield a mixed phase of cubic and hexagonal polymorphs closely related to RCD. We use Monte Carlo simulations to show how these routes avoid a metastable amorphous phase. Finally, we show that both the polymorphs support spectrally overlapping PBGs.

Self-assembly appeals as a bottom-up route for structure fabrication, but self-assembly of colloidal open crystals has proven to be elusive for their mechanical instability due to being low-coordinated. For such a bottom-up route to yield a desired colloidal open crystal, the target structure is required to be thermodynamically favored for designer building blocks and also kinetically accessible via self-assembly pathways in preference to metastable structures. Additionally, the selection of a particular polymorph poses a challenge for certain much sought-after colloidal open crystals for their applications as photonic crystals. Here, we devise hierarchical self-assembly pathways, which, starting from designer triblock patchy particles, yield in a cascade of well-separated associations first tetrahedral clusters and then tetrastack crystals. The designed pathways avoid trapping into an amorphous phase. Our analysis reveals how such a two-stage self-assembly pathway via tetrahedral clusters promotes crystallization by suppressing five- and seven-membered rings that hinder the emergence of the ordered structure. We also find that slow annealing promotes a bias toward the cubic polymorph relative to the hexagonal counterpart. Finally, we calculate the photonic band structures, showing that the cubic polymorph exhibits a complete photonic band gap for the dielectric filling fraction directly realizable from the designer triblock patchy particles. Unexpectedly, we find that the hexagonal polymorph also supports a complete photonic band gap, albeit only for an increased filling fraction, which can be realized via postassembly processing.","tags":[],"title":"Leveraging hierarchical self-assembly pathways for realizing colloidal photonic crystals","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Background Theory \\begin{equation} \\langle X\\rangle = \\dfrac{\\int\\text{d}q^{N}\\exp\\big[-\\beta\\mathcal{V}(q^{N})\\big]X(q^{N})}{\\int\\text{d}q^{N}~\\exp\\big[-\\beta\\mathcal{V}(q^{N})\\big]} \\end{equation}\nMetropolis Criterion This can be alternatively written down as: \\begin{equation} \\text{acc}(o\\rightarrow n)=\\min\\bigg(1,\\exp\\bigg[-\\beta\\big(\\mathcal{V}(n)-\\mathcal{V}(o)\\big)\\bigg]\\bigg) \\end{equation}\nThe Code We want to build a Monte Carlo package in javascript using object-oriented programming\nSetting up the System class System { // set initial system parameters constructor(){ this.npart = 100; // number of particles in the system this.density = 0.4; // density of the system this.area = (this.npart*20**2)/this.density; // area of the simulation box this.box_x = Math.sqrt(this.area); // length of the box along the x-axis this.box_y = this.box_x; // length of the box along the y-axis this.particles = []; // list of particles in the system } } Final Result ","date":1559476407,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559476407,"objectID":"269c3cc8a61987fe6ea69ce47143e4a0","permalink":"https://andneo.github.io/post/hs_mc/","publishdate":"2019-06-02T12:53:27+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/hs_mc/","section":"post","summary":"Performing particle simulations in the browser sing javascript.","tags":[],"title":"Hard-Disk Monte Carlo","type":"post"},{"authors":["Zihao Ou","Binbin Luo","Andreas Neophytou","Dwaipayan Chakrabarti","Qian Chen"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"b53c81bcb9ea753f5b325055dfbcd04e","permalink":"https://andneo.github.io/publication/19_01_01_frontiers/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/19_01_01_frontiers/","section":"publication","summary":"The emergence of order from disorder is a common theme in nature—the formation of cell membranes from phospholipids, the crystallization of water molecules into snowflakes, and the intertwining of DNA strands into helices are just a few examples. The term “self-assembly” refers to the spontaneous formation of an ordered structure or pattern from its initially disordered components without any human intervention (Whitesides and Grzybowski, 2002). In particular, self-assembly provides a promising bottom-up route to three-dimensional (3D) structures. In the context of programming self-assembly, which requires encoding the information of the target structure into the building blocks, colloidal particles are especially attractive building blocks because of the scope for tuning the interparticle interactions (Cademartiri and Bishop, 2015; Glotzer and Solomon, 2007; Whitesides and Boncheva, 2002). In recent years, the availability of a rich arsenal of colloidal building blocks, thanks to advances in synthetic methods, has paved the way for an exotic variety of self-assembled structures. However, understanding the physical principles, which govern the self-assembly of these building blocks, holds the key to programming self-assembly into target structures. In the present chapter, we discuss synthetic methods for Janus and multipatch colloidal particles and their self-assembly behavior, largely targeted for open crystals, which have appealing applications as photonic crystals as well as phononic and mechanical metamaterials (Aryana and Zanjani, 2018; Joannopoulos, 1997; Mao and Lubensky, 2018).","tags":[],"title":"Synthesis and self-assembly of janus and triblock patchy particles","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
